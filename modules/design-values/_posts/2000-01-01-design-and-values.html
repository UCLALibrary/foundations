<h2>The importance of values-driven design.</h2>

<p>Values are essential, but at times hidden, aspects of the design process. Creative teams often either assume they share the same values or ignore the role of values in their work. As a result, creators may or may not be aware of the many ways in which their values influence both the creative process, and the things they create together.</p>

<!--<p>At the same time, we may not always take notice of the underlying values that guided the creation of the physical and digital environments we use and navigate every day.</p>-->

<!-- notes:
* the things you and your team make together will express and embody your values
* the purpose of your work is important for making difficult design decisions
* how you make together matters, too -

<p>In this section, you'll reflect on your individual values as a creator, and begin the process of articulating shared values with your team. <!--We'll start by noticing and exploring the sometimes hidden values in physical and digital environments. Then, we'll being the process of articulating the personal and shared values in the work you and your team are doing together.--> The goal will be able to come to a shared understanding of <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> you and your team will create together.</p>

<!-- Insert here an interactive reader in which learners explore and reflect on the expressed/embodied values in everyday objects/spaces/services -->

<p>To do this, we'll adopt the framework of the <em>manifesto</em>. Manifestos, as a genre, can serve as a unifying call-to-action, and an inspiring articulation of how shared values take shape in the world. Manifestos also invariably involve both taking a position, and defining a direction.</p>
