<h2>Your team's design manifesto.</h2>

<p>What values will guide your team's work? When faced with challenging decisions, too many options, or not enough paths forward, what will you do?</p>

<p>Values-driven design can help you and your team overcome the most difficult challenges. And co-articulating shared values with your team is an inspiring way to launch a design process.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Work together with your team to create a team manifesto that articulates your shared values and aspirations for your work together.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take turns sharing ideas for your team manifesto. You can draw on the statements you added to your personal manifesto and create new statements that are focused on teamwork and collaboration.</li>
        <li>Looks for opportunities to combine similar ideas and statements.</li>
        <li>Work together in a shared space, e.g., in a google doc or on a chalkboard, to co-articulate shared values.</li>
        <li>Use dot-voting, or a similar technique, to identify the values that resonate most with your team. See <a href="https://mindiply.com/blog/post/how-to-make-better-group-decision-with-dot-voting" target="_blank">examples of how to set up a dot-voting activity</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>Take the time to ask clarifying questions and also to up-vote the ideas that resonate with you.</li>

        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't worry too much about exact wording at this point. The most useful manifestos are dynamic documents that evolve with your team. Plan on this being a working document for now, and then set up a time for your team to update and revise the document. Often working together for a time can bring forth important values and approaches.</li>
            <li>Have fun with this process! It can be a great way for a team to get to know each other and better understand other people's thought processes and ways of working.</li>
