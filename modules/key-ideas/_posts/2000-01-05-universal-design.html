<h2>What is universal design?</h2>

<p>Universal design calls for:</p>
    
<blockquote>The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071827/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm" target="_blank">The Center for Universal Design - NC State University, 1997</a>).</blockquote>

<p>When designing for learners, this means that learning experiences and materials benefit ALL students when learning materials are accessible, diverse and inclusive.</p>

For a brief overview of the concept of Universal Design check out this interactive reader:

    <h3 class="card-title">Exploring Universal Design for Learning</h3>
    <p>With your team, explore the diversity of learners, their experiences, and their different approaches to learning by discussing the following questions and completing the follow activities together:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Have you ever had a learning experience that you felt just wasn't designed for you? How will this impact your team's design approach?</li>
		  <li>Next, choose a website that your team frequently uses, and explore it using WAVE - the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool: <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">http://wave.webaim.org/</a>. This tool gives you a chance to take a behind the scenes look at the accessibility of a website and identify both best practices and areas of improvement.</li>
		  <li>What did you notice about the website you visited? In what ways is it accessible? How could it be improved?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Additional questions to discuss if you have time:</p>
		  <ul>
			   <li>Imagine there were a tool like webaim for physical spaces, products, or services (in other words things that aren't online). How would it work? What factors would it consider? </li>
		  <li>What roles do universal design and accessibility play in designs outside of the web? Can you think of a non-digital product or service that seems to have been created with universal design and accessibility in mind? What about the opposite?</li>
