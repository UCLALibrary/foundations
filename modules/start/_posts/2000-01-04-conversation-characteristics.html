<h2>What makes memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning happen?</h2>

<p>In this part of the activity, you'll turn your experiences into a list of characteristics of memorable, meaningful, and transformative learning. Over time, you'll develop your list to explore how to make your designs more memorable, meaningful, and transformative.</p>

         <h3 class="mt-3">Part 1</h3>
         <p class="card-text">Think about the stories shared in the previous activity. Work with your team to brainstorm a list of the characteristics of learning and/or design you noticed in these stories. It might help you to think about how you would complete the following sentences for learning and/or design:</p>
	  	<h4>Design for Learning:</h4>
         <blockquote>Learning is most memorable when: ______________.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Learning is most meaningful when: ______________.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Learning is most transformative when: ______________.</blockquote>
	  
	  <h4>Design for UX:</h4>
         <blockquote>Design is most memorable when: ______________.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Design is most meaningful when: ______________.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Design is most transformative when: ______________.</blockquote>

            <ul>
                <li>Try completing the phrases from multiple perspectives, including teachers, learners, and the learning enviornment, as well as motivational and contextual factors.<!-- todo: include an example here --></li>
