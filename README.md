### Where's the course content?

The content for the course is found in the [modules folder](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/foundations/tree/gh-pages/modules). Every module in the course has a subfolder inside the modules folder. And inside every module folder, you will find a special folder called `_posts`, eg. `key-ideas/_posts`. Inside the folder called `_posts`, you will find an `html` or `markdown` file for each page in the module. The filenames for this files start with the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-sectionname.md`. The date determines the order of the sections in the module.

An example of the file layout for this course:

```
modules/key-ideas/_posts/2000-01-01-key-ideas.html
modules/key-ideas/_posts/2000-01-02-active-learning.html
...
```

See [https://howto.p2pu.org/modules/tutorial/start/](https://howto.p2pu.org/modules/tutorial/start/) for more information on the structure and organization of this course.

### What are "interactive readers"?

In this course we use *interactive readers* to quickly present key ideas on teaching and learning (aka "learning theory). Our hope is that these readers are:

* very short (i.e., sentences and paragraphs instead of articles)
* interactive in that they prompt the reader to engage with the text in multiple ways
* potentially collaborative in that they can be completed as a team activity (but also individually, if necessary)

The interactive readers were created using [h5p](https://h5p.org/), a free tool for creating interactive content. Our h5p activities are currently hosted in UCLA Library's Moodle site. To suggest an improvement or change to one of the interactive readers, please submit an [issues](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/foundations/issues) letting us know your ideas and advice!
